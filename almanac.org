#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Yours looks so nice!
#+END_QUOTE

Thanks!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  But I'd like mine to work by keeping entries in a single file (or collecting them from multiple files), rather than storing one entry per file.
#+END_QUOTE

Why "But"? :) I do exactly that i.e. [[https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/kaushalmodi.gitlab.io/blob/master/content-org/scripter-posts.org][multiple posts from one Org file]]. Well, not exactly that. I have a mix of one post per file and multiple posts per file. For example, [[https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/kaushalmodi.gitlab.io/blob/master/content-org/notes/nim.org][my Nim notes]] ( [[https://scripter.co/notes/nim/][HTML]]) got too out of hand, and won't suit in the above file. So I kept it separate (and same for other notes).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  that's possible, but maybe requires custom code. Do you have any thoughts about that?
#+END_QUOTE

I am not sure which custom code you are referring to (the subtree-to-file and file-to-file export code is part of =ox-hugo=). If you see any of the Org files, they are normal Org files, with adding of /#+hugo../ keywords and /:EXPORT\_HUGO\_../ properties.

Or, do you mean how to do the same if not planning to use Hugo?

Engineer and programmer, with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and working at Xaar in Cambridge, UK. Before that I worked at Hewlett Packard's research and development lab since 1996. With over 40 US patents filed, at least 12 of them granted and the rest pending. I am currently working on the data pipeline of a 3D printer.

My latest personal project is GreaterSkies, selling personalized star charts as a high-quality PDF. You choose the location, date and time, and my Common Lisp engine will create for you a beautiful chart with thousands of stars and the planets as seen from that place and at that time.

I'm a software engineer based in the north east of England. This is my personal site, and opinions expressed here do not reflect those of my employer.

I'm originally from the west coast of Norway. I studied electronics, and served as a sonar operator on a submarine during compulsory military service, before moving to London to study AI. I graduated from the University of Westminster in 2003, and have been working primarily as a backend software engineer since.

I build this website in Emacs' Org mode, which can publish static HTML files. Those I deploy on Amazon S3 behind a CloudFront distribution and a free SSL certificate.

=org-collector= is a library in =org-contrib= that collects headline properties into tables with optional pre-processing.  Here's a simple example from its documentation:

Given the following Org buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Spending

  ,** December

     :END:

  ,*** Week 1

       :PROPERTIES:
       :amount:   30.67

=org-ql= provides a query language for Org files. It offers two syntax styles: Lisp-like sexps and search engine-like keywords.

It includes three libraries: The =org-ql= library is flexible and may be used as a backend for other tools. The libraries =org-ql-search= and =helm-org-ql= provide interactive search commands and saved views.

Here are a few examples of the Lisp-side of the library.  See the examples and screenshots on its home page for more information.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Five years ago, my life exploded in complexity. I had just started a new position in a new field. I was planning my wedding. And my inability to say NO to anyone and everyone had culminated in my serving on the board of three graduate student organizations. Inevitably, cracks began to form, and my finite brain started to lose track of tasks. My calendar was sufficient to ensure that I wouldn't miss meetings, but I would often only prepare for those meetings at the eleventh hour. My productivity and the quality of my work both suffered. Something needed to change.

This guide is devoted to a discussion of the organizational system that I have honed in the time since.Many of the ideas presented here derive from the Getting Things Done methodology, but adapted and expanded to meet my personal needs. With it, I have found that my time is spent more wisely. Better organization means that I can consciously devote effort where it is needed early on, as opposed to scrambling to keep up, and deliver higher quality work without expending more energy.

You too can streamline your process. This guide is meant to serve as an example of how you might reorganize your workflow and find order through the chaos of your busy life. Yet different lifestyles have different demands: what works for me may not work as well for you. As such, I do not expect that you will replicate this system in its entirety. Instead, I hope you will take inspiration from my system and use elements of it to build a workflow that works for you.

orgstrap is a specification and tooling for bootstrapping Org files.

It allows Org files to describe their own requirements, and define their own functionality, making them self-contained standalone computational artifacts dependent only on Emacs or other implementations of the Org Babel protocol in the future.

orgstrap works with all versions of Emacs since 24.4 and all versions of Org since 8.2.10.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I’ve been maintaining a simple static website for my jujutsu club since 1985. For most of that time it was simply hand coded HTML and CSS. I’ve wanted to update the site for a while to give it a more modern look, and to handle mobile devices better. I also wanted to move away from hand-coding the HTML and so was interested by org-mode’s HTML export capacity.

The HTML exporter backend that ships with org-mode didn’t produce the structure I was looking for, and I found myself spending an age fighting the CSS to try to produce the appearance I was after in a range of browsers.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Major tasks, such as research, go in a plain list under TODO. They are hyperlinked to the relevant part of the text with #+NAME: comments. For minor stuff, I just use a comment with an arbitrary prefix (tt), so I can easily I-search (C-s, I think. I use evil) for it. I could automate things with capture, but I haven't gotten around to setting it up.

I use priority tags to measure how far a scene is in production, since they are separate from TODO keywords. Any motifs, items, characters, etc. that need to be tracked, I create a tag/property for. I can then use C-c / together with indirect buffers to filter the information.

*** Tips                                                             :tips:

**** Exclude and include tags in custom Agenda commands

Commands like =org-tags-view= naturally offer the ability to control which tags are used to filter items, but such filtering is less obvious when using daily/weekly Agenda commands.  However, doing so is straightforward using the variable =org-agenda-tag-filter=.  For example, Org user Stig Brautaset offers [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2020-02/msg00533.html][this example]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("w" "Work Agenda"
           ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'day)))
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-agenda-tag-filter '("-@home" "-MAYBE"))))
          ("h" "Home Agenda"
           ((agenda "")
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-agenda-tag-filter '("-@work" "-MAYBE"))))
          ("m" "Maybe"
           ((todo "PROJ")
            (tags-todo "-PROJ/TODO"))
           ((org-agenda-tag-filter '("+MAYBE"))))
          ("P" "Projects" tags-todo "-MAYBE/PROJ"))))
#+END_SRC

Alternatives include:

+  Using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]] to build Agenda-like views using queries, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql-search (org-agenda-files)
    '(and (or (deadline auto)
              (scheduled :to today)
              (ts-active :on today))
          (not (or (todo "MAYBE")
                   (tags "@home")))))
#+END_SRC

+  Using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] to group and/or discard certain items, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("w" "Work Agenda"
           ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'day)))
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:tags "@home" :todo "MAYBE"))))))
          ("h" "Home Agenda"
           ((agenda "")
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:tags "@work" :todo "MAYBE")))))))))

*** Headings

**** Excluding and including

To /exclude/ certain headings from being exported, use a =:noexport:= tag on them, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Heading 1

  This heading will be exported.

  ,* Heading 2                                                        :noexport:

  This heading will not.
#+END_SRC

To /include/ certain headings (i.e. to exclude all headings by default), use an =:export= tag, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Heading 1

  This heading will not be exported.

  ,* Heading 2                                                          :export:

  This heading will be.
#+END_SRC

The manual explains these export option keywords:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
+  =SELECT_TAGS= :: The default value is ~("export")~. When a tree is tagged with ~export~ (=org-export-select-tags=), Org selects that tree and its sub-trees for export. Org excludes trees with ~noexport~ tags, see below. When selectively exporting files with ~export~ tags set, Org does not export any text that appears before the first headline.

+ =EXCLUDE_TAGS= :: The default value is ~("noexport")~. When a tree is tagged with ~noexport~ (=org-export-exclude-tags=), Org excludes that tree and its sub-trees from export. Entries tagged with ~noexport~ are unconditionally excluded from the export, even if they have an ~export~ tag. Even if a sub-tree is not exported, Org executes any code blocks contained there.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Properties

[2020-02-13 Thu 01:31]  To export drawers with specific properties, use this syntax:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+OPTIONS: prop:("property1" "property2")

  ,* Subtree
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_OPTIONS: prop:("property1" "property2")
  :END:

  To set this option for a subtree, use a drawer like the one above.
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, to export a single property at a specific place, you can use an Org macro, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  {{{property(property1)}}}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This trick is in the org-mode manual but it’s worth a quick mention in its own right. If you want to start a numbered list in org-mode from a number other than 1, then put [@N] at the start of the first item, where N is the number you want to start with. So for
example,

 1) item 1
 2) item 2

This text would interrupt the list and the next item would be 1) on a
new list

 3) [@3] This will be item 3 thanks to [@3]
 4) and this will be item 4

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you use TODO-state logging by default but want to disable it for a file, add this line at the top of the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
   #+PROPERTY: LOGGING nil
#+END_SRC
Note: It must be capitalized exactly as shown.

It took some searching of the manual and some trial-and-error to find the right combination. Maybe this will save someone else the trouble someday. :)

** TODO Move attachments from data dir to parent data dir         :noexport:

[2020-02-13 Thu 18:54]  Org 9.0.5 doesn't correctly inherit =ATTACH_DIR= properties set in =#+PROPERTY= lines.  Newer versions of Org look like they do.  So after I upgrade Org, I'll have to move attachments from this =pub/data= dir to the parent =data= dir.

** TODO Recursive sort function

Should probably support subtree-specific sort functions.

** Resources to add

*** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9BcZvQbXU][Consistent Technical Documents Using Emacs and Org Mode - YouTube]]

This is an excellent demonstration of using Org and Org Babel to produce technical documentation.

** TODO Sort by timestamp function

Should support timestamps in property values.
