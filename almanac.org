#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Yours looks so nice!
#+END_QUOTE

Thanks!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  But I'd like mine to work by keeping entries in a single file (or collecting them from multiple files), rather than storing one entry per file.
#+END_QUOTE

Why "But"? :) I do exactly that i.e. [[https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/kaushalmodi.gitlab.io/blob/master/content-org/scripter-posts.org][multiple posts from one Org file]]. Well, not exactly that. I have a mix of one post per file and multiple posts per file. For example, [[https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/kaushalmodi.gitlab.io/blob/master/content-org/notes/nim.org][my Nim notes]] ( [[https://scripter.co/notes/nim/][HTML]]) got too out of hand, and won't suit in the above file. So I kept it separate (and same for other notes).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  that's possible, but maybe requires custom code. Do you have any thoughts about that?
#+END_QUOTE

I am not sure which custom code you are referring to (the subtree-to-file and file-to-file export code is part of =ox-hugo=). If you see any of the Org files, they are normal Org files, with adding of /#+hugo../ keywords and /:EXPORT\_HUGO\_../ properties.

Or, do you mean how to do the same if not planning to use Hugo?

Engineer and programmer, with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and working at Xaar in Cambridge, UK. Before that I worked at Hewlett Packard's research and development lab since 1996. With over 40 US patents filed, at least 12 of them granted and the rest pending. I am currently working on the data pipeline of a 3D printer.

My latest personal project is GreaterSkies, selling personalized star charts as a high-quality PDF. You choose the location, date and time, and my Common Lisp engine will create for you a beautiful chart with thousands of stars and the planets as seen from that place and at that time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Just over a year ago now, I finally opened the bakery I’d been dreaming of for years. It’s been a big change in my life, from spending all my time sat in front of a computer, to spending most of it making actual stuff. And stuff that makes people happy, at that. It’s been a huge change, but I can’t think of a single job change that’s ever made me as happy as this one.

One of the big changes that came with going pro was that suddenly I was having to work out how much stuff I needed to mix to fill the orders I needed. On the face of it, this is really simple, just work out how much dough you need, then work out what quantities to mix to make that much dough. Easy. You can do it with a pencil and paper. Or, in traditional bakers' fashion, by scrawling with your finger on a floured work bench.

And that’s how I coped for a few weeks early on. But I kept making mistakes, which makes for an inconsistent product (bread is very forgiving, you have to work quite hard to make something that isn’t bread, but consistency matters). I needed to automate.

At an abstract level, what this package does is take a one-dimensional description and render it as a three-dimensional ascii drawing. This is similar to how communicating locations of things in real life works: the knowledgeable party forms a one-dimensional sentence that describes a thing and the receiving party forms a three-dimensional image in their mind. This mental image arranges the nouns from the sentence according to the prepositions surrounding them.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Five years ago, my life exploded in complexity. I had just started a new position in a new field. I was planning my wedding. And my inability to say NO to anyone and everyone had culminated in my serving on the board of three graduate student organizations. Inevitably, cracks began to form, and my finite brain started to lose track of tasks. My calendar was sufficient to ensure that I wouldn't miss meetings, but I would often only prepare for those meetings at the eleventh hour. My productivity and the quality of my work both suffered. Something needed to change.

This guide is devoted to a discussion of the organizational system that I have honed in the time since.Many of the ideas presented here derive from the Getting Things Done methodology, but adapted and expanded to meet my personal needs. With it, I have found that my time is spent more wisely. Better organization means that I can consciously devote effort where it is needed early on, as opposed to scrambling to keep up, and deliver higher quality work without expending more energy.

You too can streamline your process. This guide is meant to serve as an example of how you might reorganize your workflow and find order through the chaos of your busy life. Yet different lifestyles have different demands: what works for me may not work as well for you. As such, I do not expect that you will replicate this system in its entirety. Instead, I hope you will take inspiration from my system and use elements of it to build a workflow that works for you.

I’ve been maintaining a simple static website for my jujutsu club since 1985. For most of that time it was simply hand coded HTML and CSS. I’ve wanted to update the site for a while to give it a more modern look, and to handle mobile devices better. I also wanted to move away from hand-coding the HTML and so was interested by org-mode’s HTML export capacity.

The HTML exporter backend that ships with org-mode didn’t produce the structure I was looking for, and I found myself spending an age fighting the CSS to try to produce the appearance I was after in a range of browsers.

Although it is called Tailwind, the only thing that it does is allowing you to customize the classes of the HTML and exporting a more barebones HTML (It does not create as many divs and sections as the normal HTML export back-end). Instead of using Tailwind.css you can just name the classes of the elements and import your own css (or edit ./css/style.css).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Major tasks, such as research, go in a plain list under TODO. They are hyperlinked to the relevant part of the text with #+NAME: comments. For minor stuff, I just use a comment with an arbitrary prefix (tt), so I can easily I-search (C-s, I think. I use evil) for it. I could automate things with capture, but I haven't gotten around to setting it up.

I use priority tags to measure how far a scene is in production, since they are separate from TODO keywords. Any motifs, items, characters, etc. that need to be tracked, I create a tag/property for. I can then use C-c / together with indirect buffers to filter the information.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Binder is global minor mode (and associated major modes) to facilitate working on a writing project in multiple files.  It is heavily inspired by the binder feature in the macOS writing app Scrivener.  The rationale behind working this way is to split a large writing project into much smaller pieces.

**** Exclude and include tags in custom Agenda commands

Commands like =org-tags-view= naturally offer the ability to control which tags are used to filter items, but such filtering is less obvious when using daily/weekly Agenda commands.  However, doing so is straightforward using the variable =org-agenda-tag-filter=.  For example, Org user Stig Brautaset offers [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2020-02/msg00533.html][this example]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("w" "Work Agenda"
           ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'day)))
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-agenda-tag-filter '("-@home" "-MAYBE"))))
          ("h" "Home Agenda"
           ((agenda "")
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-agenda-tag-filter '("-@work" "-MAYBE"))))
          ("m" "Maybe"
           ((todo "PROJ")
            (tags-todo "-PROJ/TODO"))
           ((org-agenda-tag-filter '("+MAYBE"))))
          ("P" "Projects" tags-todo "-MAYBE/PROJ"))))
#+END_SRC

Alternatives include:

+  Using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]] to build Agenda-like views using queries, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql-search (org-agenda-files)
    '(and (or (deadline auto)
              (scheduled :to today)
              (ts-active :on today))
          (not (or (todo "MAYBE")
                   (tags "@home")))))
#+END_SRC

+  Using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] to group and/or discard certain items, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("w" "Work Agenda"
           ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'day)))
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:tags "@home" :todo "MAYBE"))))))
          ("h" "Home Agenda"
           ((agenda "")
            (todo "TODO"
                  ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'all)
                   (org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp 'all))))
           ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:tags "@work" :todo "MAYBE")))))))))

*** Headings

**** Excluding and including

To /exclude/ certain headings from being exported, use a =:noexport:= tag on them, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Heading 1

  This heading will be exported.

  ,* Heading 2                                                        :noexport:

  This heading will not.
#+END_SRC

To /include/ certain headings (i.e. to exclude all headings by default), use an =:export= tag, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Heading 1

  This heading will not be exported.

  ,* Heading 2                                                          :export:

  This heading will be.
#+END_SRC

The manual explains these export option keywords:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
+  =SELECT_TAGS= :: The default value is ~("export")~. When a tree is tagged with ~export~ (=org-export-select-tags=), Org selects that tree and its sub-trees for export. Org excludes trees with ~noexport~ tags, see below. When selectively exporting files with ~export~ tags set, Org does not export any text that appears before the first headline.

+ =EXCLUDE_TAGS= :: The default value is ~("noexport")~. When a tree is tagged with ~noexport~ (=org-export-exclude-tags=), Org excludes that tree and its sub-trees from export. Entries tagged with ~noexport~ are unconditionally excluded from the export, even if they have an ~export~ tag. Even if a sub-tree is not exported, Org executes any code blocks contained there.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Properties

[2020-02-13 Thu 01:31]  To export drawers with specific properties, use this syntax:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+OPTIONS: prop:("property1" "property2")

  ,* Subtree
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_OPTIONS: prop:("property1" "property2")
  :END:

  To set this option for a subtree, use a drawer like the one above.
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, to export a single property at a specific place, you can use an Org macro, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  {{{property(property1)}}}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This trick is in the org-mode manual but it’s worth a quick mention in its own right. If you want to start a numbered list in org-mode from a number other than 1, then put [@N] at the start of the first item, where N is the number you want to start with. So for
example,

 1) item 1
 2) item 2

This text would interrupt the list and the next item would be 1) on a
new list

 3) [@3] This will be item 3 thanks to [@3]

[2018-06-11 Mon 06:42]  I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/4ekcy9/howto_disable_todostate_logging_for_a_file/][this page]] on Google, which I apparently posted to Reddit two years ago:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you use TODO-state logging by default but want to disable it for a file, add this line at the top of the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
   #+PROPERTY: LOGGING nil
#+END_SRC
Note: It must be capitalized exactly as shown.

It took some searching of the manual and some trial-and-error to find the right combination. Maybe this will save someone else the trouble someday. :)

**** [[https://github.com/Ferada/cl-org-mode-parser][cl-org-mode-parser: Parsing org-mode files]]         :Lisp:Common_Lisp:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are actually a lot of other packages for the same purpose. The aim of this one is to parse org-mode files via a SAX-like event interface into e.g. CLOS-based documents and to offer some options with regards to parsed elements, interning of tags and similar things.

The parser is currently line- and regex-based, however it might be feasible to use a parser generator instead. For that the syntax description at worg is canonical and should probably be used.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It documents the syntax in a standard and machine readable notation (EBNF). And the reference implementation is done in a way that it runs on the established virtual machines of Java and JavaScript. Hence, org-parser can be used from all programming languages running on those virtual machines. org-parser provides a higher-level data structure that is easy to consume for an application working with Org mode data. Even if your application is not running on the Java or JavaScript virtual machines, you can embed org-parser as a command-line application. Lastly, org-parser brings a strong test suite to document the reference implementation in yet another unambiguous way.

It is our aim that org-parser can be the foundation on which many Org mode applications in many different languages can be built. The applications using org-parser can then focus on implementing user facing features and don’t have to worry about the implementation of the Org syntax itself.

**** [[https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs][org-rs: org-mode parser rewrite in Rust]]                        :Rust:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org is probably the best and most complete plain text organizational system known to mankind. It has countless applications like authoring, publishing, task and time tracking, journal, blog, agenda, wiki etc...

Unfortunately Org was originally developed for Emacs and therefore available only inside Emacs. It is a huge limiting factor for Org's development and popularization. Because of that it is not as popular outside of Emacs community as it should be.

Many attempts were made to fix this. It all starts with a parser. But because Org's syntax is not trivial and in fact most of it is context-sensitive with only a few context-free elements, it is quite easy to get it wrong. Some Org parsers have chosen to focus on a restricted subset of Org's syntax like org-ruby or pandoc. More ambitious projects try to cover all features but since Org does not have a formal specification1 they rely on observed Org's behavior in Emacs or author's intuition. As a result they rarely get finished.

But the absence of a good a spec and the complexity of the grammar are not show stoppers. Why reinventing the wheel when we can just copy it! This project takes the only surefire way to get it right - use the original elisp parser implementation as a blueprint!

This package allows you to parse raw Org Mode documents into a structured in-memory representation.  This parser was developed for an application that is halfway between pretty-printing and evaluating/interpreting, so in many cases the parsed structure does not split out constituent parts as thoroughly as needed for some applications.
